  <p class="about-text">One of the most integral cores of the NEWGIZA community
is the NEWGIZA Sports Club (NGSC). Offering leisure, recreational
and sport activities, NGSC welcomes both residents and
non-residents into its integrated sports complex and caters to
all ages and levels of fitness. With a wide range of world-class
facilities and services to choose from, NGSC will act as both a
social and sporting hub.<br><br>
One thing about NGSC – there is never a dull moment. The club
boasts of an array of activities for all occasions. You can get to
know your neighbors in the Blue Lodge, or work out the stress
of the day either at the Greenheart Park or the gym. Then again,
while you take a few laps in the swimming pool, or thrash it out
on the squash courts, your children can find themselves busy
and mingling with friends at the Kids Temple or the adjoining
football field.<br><br>
Running a healthy lifestyle is vital to us at NGSC, hence we have
carefully designed activities and different areas tailored to each
age group. An outdoor fitness area is especially dedicated for
adults and seniors, who can enjoy an exclusive workout amidst
an age-restricted area in the Greenheart Park, overlooking the
splendid view of the vast green fields.<br><br>
NGSC also holds children in high regard by dedicating special
programs and activities that suit their interest. The Kids
Temple is the largest and most ultimate kid’s park in the 6th of
October area that features a state-of-the-art waterpark as well
as both a play and birthday area that are fully-furnished by a
world-class signature brand for kid’s area structures.
The Grand Lodge invites its members to a calmer setting, with
quality signature restaurants, a tea garden, salons for get-togethers,
a conference room and additional entertainment facilities,
making NGSC an exceptional community and sports venue
for children, adult and senior members.
