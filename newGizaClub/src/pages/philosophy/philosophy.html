  <p class="about-text">NGSC is driven by three core pillars: Social, Sports and Leisure. The
Social pillar is run by the full-fledge of sports facilities and buildings
that integrate the members within a community of shared
interest and common values. The Sports pillar is powered by
providing unparalleled facilities to power the member’s physical
and mental wellbeing. Whereas, the Leisure pillar is evident
in the club’s wide-range of tranquil and dynamic recreational
experiences.<br><br>
Recreation is about activities and experiences which
produce feelings of joy and satisfaction. They offer
opportunities to express creativity as well as achieve
and master new skills.<br><br>
Innovation is key to NGSC’s philosophy, which
boasts it as the number one hub with progressive,
cutting-edge facilities that are regularly maintained
and upgraded, as well as state-of-the-art
programs and activities that cater to all ages,
especially children.<br><br>
Driven by a strong belief that kids shape
future generations, we strive to stimulate
their mental and physical growths by
activating and boosting their young
minds and bodies through an array of
programs and activities. Accordingly,
we encourage our children to power
through and contribute as competitive
individuals and champions
for centuries to come.</p>
